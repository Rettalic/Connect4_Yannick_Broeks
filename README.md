# Connect4_Yannick_Broeks

This is my take on Connect 4.
I mainly focused on creating an AI-Agent that is really hard to beat (but plays fair). 
So I used the **"Monte Carlo tree search"**-Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search#:~:text=The%20focus%20of%20MCTS%20is,%2C%20also%20called%20roll%2Douts.) 

The MCTS works by trying out different moves, keeping track of what works best, and focusing on those good moves. It repeats this process many times, getting better at making decisions with each try. 
This helps it figure out the best moves to make in a game or find good solutions to problems. MCTS is like a clever strategy that combines trying new things with what it already knows to make better choices over time.

I learned a lot during this project, such as threading, algorithms and how to call events.
There are things to improve still, like making the code more loose coupled or optimising it even more.

During the proces of creating this game I tried to create a clear code structure with consistent coding standards.
